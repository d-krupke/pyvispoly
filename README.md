# pyvispoly

This package provides a Python interface to the [CGAL](https://www.cgal.org/)
library for computing visibility polygons. It is exact, but not necessarily
efficient.

**Motivation:** This package was developed in the context of implementing an
exact solver for the dispersive Art Gallery Problem
([see here](https://github.com/d-krupke/dispersive_agp_solver)). Because the
problem is difficult and only reasonably small instances can be solved, the
focus of this package is on correctness and not on efficiency.

## Installation

You can install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install --verbose .
```

or directly via PyPI:

```bash
pip install --verbose pyvispoly
```

During installation, it will download and install CGAL and its dependencies.
This may take a while. This requires a C++-compiler to be installed on your
system.

> :info: On installation problems, please first check out
> [skbuild-conan's troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/d-krupke/skbuild-conan#common-problems).
> It is likely that the automatic C++-compilation fails.

## Addressing the Complexity of Visibility Polygon Computation

Computing visibility polygons demands precise arithmetic; imprecise calculations
often yield incorrect results. This package leverages the robustness of the CGAL
library for accurate visibility polygon computation. Note that it is essential
to convert your coordinates to CGAL's exact number type. Failure to use the
correct types may result in exceptions.

This package explicitly avoids duck typing and automatic type conversion. While
these features could simplify usage, they risk obscuring underlying errors in
your code. In geometric computations, precision is paramount; thus, Python's
native floating-point numbers are unsuitable.

## Usage

```python
# import elements from pyvispoly
from pyvispoly import (
    FieldNumber,
    Point,
    Polygon,
    PolygonWithHoles,
    VisibilityPolygonCalculator,
    plot_polygon,
)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

```python
# exact number type
a = FieldNumber(100)
b = FieldNumber(200)
c = a + b
assert isinstance(c, FieldNumber)
print("c:", c)
print("float(c):", float(c))
assert float(c) == 300.0
```

    c: 300.000000
    float(c): 300.0

```python
# point type
p1 = Point(FieldNumber(0), FieldNumber(0))
assert p1.x() == FieldNumber(0) and p1.y() == FieldNumber(0)
p2 = Point(2, 3)
p3 = Point(4.0, 5.0)
print("p1:", p1)
print("p2:", p2)
print("p3:", p3)
```

    p1: (0, 0)
    p2: (2, 3)
    p3: (4, 5)

```python
# Polygon
poly1 = Polygon([Point(0, 0), Point(1, 0), Point(1, 1), Point(0, 1)])
assert poly1.is_simple()
assert poly1.area() == FieldNumber(1)
assert float(poly1.area()) == 1.0
```

```python
# The ccw order of the points is important
poly1 = Polygon([Point(0, 0), Point(1, 0), Point(1, 1), Point(0, 1)][::-1])
assert poly1.is_simple()
assert poly1.area() == FieldNumber(-1)
assert float(poly1.area()) == -1.0
```

```python
# Polygon with holes
poly2 = PolygonWithHoles(
    [Point(0, 0), Point(1, 0), Point(1, 1), Point(0, 1)],
    [
        [Point(0.25, 0.25), Point(0.75, 0.25), Point(0.75, 0.75), Point(0.25, 0.75)][
            ::-1
        ]
    ],
)
# boundary is counter-clockwise
assert poly2.outer_boundary().area() >= FieldNumber(0)
for hole in poly2.holes():
    # holes are clockwise
    assert hole.area() <= FieldNumber(0)

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.set_aspect("equal")
plot_polygon(poly2, ax=ax)
plt.show()
```

```python
# set operations on polygons
poly3 = PolygonWithHoles([Point(0, 0), Point(0.1, 0), Point(0.1, 0.1), Point(0, 0.1)])
poly4_list = poly2.difference(poly3)
assert len(poly4_list) == 1, "Expect a single polygon"
poly4 = poly4_list[0]
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.set_aspect("equal")
plot_polygon(poly4, ax=ax)
plt.show()
```

```python
# compute visibility polygon
visp_poly_calc = VisibilityPolygonCalculator(poly4)
vis_poly = visp_poly_calc.compute_visibility_polygon(Point(0.2, 0.0))

plt.plot([0.2], [0.0], "x", color="black")
plt.savefig("../docs/figures/visibility_polygon.png")

```python
# getting some interior points
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.set_aspect("equal")
plt.title("Sample points in the interior")
plot_polygon(poly4, ax=ax, color="lightgrey")
plot_polygon(vis_poly, ax=ax, color="red", alpha=0.5)
plt.plot([0.2], [0.0], "x", color="black")
interior_points = vis_poly.interior_sample_points()
for p in interior_points:
    assert vis_poly.contains(p), "all points should be inside the visibility polygon"
plt.plot(
    [p.x() for p in interior_points],
    [p.y() for p in interior_points],
    "+",
    color="black",
)
plt.show()
```

## Changelog

- **0.3.2** Upgraded pybind11 to support cmake 4.x compilation
- **0.3.1** Using CGAL6
- **0.3.0** Added `do_intersect`.
- **0.2.0** Made the library more robust and added a `repair`-method as the
  boolean operations are not always guaranteed to produce valid polygons. Note
  that this is just kind of a hack and may not always work.
- **0.1.3:** (2023-11-29) Workaround to bug in CGAL.
